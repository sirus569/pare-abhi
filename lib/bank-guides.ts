// Where to find the statement download in each bank's portal.
//
// The friction in "no bank login" onboarding isn't the upload — it's knowing
// where banks hide the PDF/OFX export. This module is the ONE source of truth
// for that knowledge, consumed by two surfaces:
//
//   1. components/upload/bank-guides.tsx — the accordion on /upload, for someone
//      who is already mid-onboarding and just needs the steps.
//   2. app/guides/* — public, indexable pages, for someone who searched
//      "how to download my CIBC statement" and has never heard of Pare.
//
// Surface 2 is why the entries carry more than `steps`: `intro`, `formats` and
// `note` exist so a standalone page has something to say beyond a bare list.
// The upload accordion ignores those fields.
//
// Generic, universal content only — same privacy rule as the starter taxonomy.
// No personal account details, no merchant names.
//
// `status` mirrors the parser registry (CLAUDE.md "Coverage status"): CIBC +
// Amex are tuned against real PDFs; the rest are scaffolds, so OFX/QFX is the
// safer first import. Keep this in sync with lib/parser/_SCAFFOLD_BANKS — a
// bank whose parser graduates from scaffold to tuned should move to "pdf".
