// the user's SQLite) and DoRepoClient (request side, forwards to the DO stub).
//
// The Repo surface is large and async; rather than hand-list every method on both
// sides (and risk drift), both sides share ONE dispatch table here. A call is a
// plain, structured-clone-safe envelope: { namespace, method, args }. The DO runs
// callRepoMethod(repo, call); the client builds the call and ships it.
//
// batch() is special: its argument is a closure, which cannot cross an RPC/DO
// boundary. Instead the client serialises the batched writes into a generic
// "__batch__" envelope (RepoBatchCall below) — a list of sub-calls the DO runs
// under ONE durability boundary via repo.batch().

// no matter how many rows/writes it contains. This is how DoRepoClient honours
// the batch() contract across the DO boundary, where the closure itself can't go.
// `returnIndex` selects which sub-call's result becomes the batch's return value
// (-1 = the last write, matching how the upload route reads its batch result).

// uses to decide buffering — so the method list and the write list cannot drift.
//
// The RepoCatalogue mapped type pins it to the Repo interface (lib/repo/types.ts)
// in BOTH directions at compile time: a method added to types.ts but missing here
// is a "property missing" error, and a catalogued name that doesn't exist on Repo
// is an excess-property error. Kept next to the dispatcher so both sides share
// one source of truth.

// "write" methods are buffered while inside DoRepoClient.batch(); "read" methods
// always pass straight through to the transport.
